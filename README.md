### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I've learned the basics of java script through the program completed for assignment 4.
   Through this, I learned how to define variables, how to do calculations, and how to
   integrate a JavaScript program with html. You are able to integrate JavaScript into html using script tags.)

2. Client Side Programming: I learned that programs are written in scripting languages like javascript, 
   jscript, VBScript. Also, that programs are used within the html of a webpage. Additionally, the browser 
   is used to compile the programs, and the output of this is the code integrated with html. Also, the user 
   is able to input information and process it.)

3. Validating Web Pages: A validating parser checks for a webpage that is well-formed, and it checks to make 
   sure that a document conforms to specific criteria. The process of validation, is verifying that the document
   is well-formed and checking the elements in a document. m/any wed-development tools have the capability to validate.)
